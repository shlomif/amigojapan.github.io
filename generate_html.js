I think there are 2 kinds of programmers,  many , maybe most, are of the kind that when compared to a painter, like to sit down with a  ruler and a pencil and slowly draw a picture, making realistic pictures....  and then there are programmers like me,  that when compared with a painter worry more about the end product than how to do the thing... so they may get out a bucket of paint, and slap some on the walls, have dirty newspapers on the floor everywhere(and they end up with some kind of abstract Picasso like painting).. but I think this kind of programming is better for inventive people... probably not for like business or medical applications.....  ' +

I am not really cut out for final products....    I don\'t think it is the same kind of people that do these things....    but often I run into people that say I should be like the painter with the ruler and paint a realistic painting, when I am really aiming for a piccaso like abstract painting' +

I stayed at one of my friend’s houses, one day while she was away at work, I stumbled on a festival where they carry the Omikoshi, I was invited to carry the Omikoshi. it was fun,  sometime during that day, I met an American girl. after meeting her a few times, she asked me to go to Kyoto with her, which was not really to my liking at the time because I was into "New Japan” not “Old Japan” back then.  But finally she convinced me to go.  when we got to Kyoto, all the hotels where booked solid, and only one place let us in, that was the Toujian backpacker’s hotel. That night it was way over crowded, they even had people sleeping on the roof(outdoors)…  My friend and I where sent to sleep on the roof, I asked one of the staff members (who ended up being my wife) to please let my friend move to a place that was not the roof. that was the first time I met my wife. One day I heard that she was going back to Saitama, so I asked her for her contact number. She gave it to me thinking I would not call.  But when I went back to the Tokyo area I asked her if I could stay in her house.  She reluctantly let me… About a month later we were married.<BR>Our marriage was just by law, we had a small party at Hotel New Koyo. Later on once our son was grown, we got professional photographs taken of us With Shiromuko Kimono and Hakama.' +

But, think of a YouTube video, every frame has 3 dimensions, breath, width and hight (z,x,y) but you can also fast forward or rewind in the dimension of time(t), but every frame of the video exists no matter what part of the video we are watching.' +

        '		<br/><br/>' +
        '		<br/>The reason why we may find ourselves always traveling foward in time may be because our bodies and  brains are chemical mechanisms and our experience of time can only happen when the chemical reactions inside our body happen. That is why asking to travel back in time is impossible.  Because the chemical process would need to work in reverse.' +

        '		<br/>Disprovability: of course we can not prove that the past or the future exist unless we can observe them in some way. We would need a way to prove that the past or future still exist to prove this hypothesis. Observing the future would probably be the best proof because it would not be a reconstruction of the past(but I guess it could be perfect forecast)' +
